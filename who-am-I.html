    <h2> Introduction </H2>

      <h2> Private </h2>

      <p>My name is Joke Lybaert, I'm 32 years old and live in Mechelen.
      I've got married in 2017 to Cedric. We have two wonderful children together: Lucas (8 years old) and Marloes (5 years old).
      We love to travel to known and lesser known places.</p>
    </br>
      <p>The weekends are for adventures. We usually go somewhere to hike or discover something new.
        I've recently started two new courses, one to become a 1* diver, the other to become a drone pilot.
      I love photography as shown <a href=photography.html> here </a>. </p>
    </br>
      <p>Some fun facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> A. As a kid I lived by the seaside. When I watch old movies I can't understand what I'm saying.</li>
        <li> B. I've got engaged in Bali and married in Thailand.</li>
        <li> C. We make an event of our kids birthday by holding a big theme party. We've had a Pokemon party, Mermaid party, ... </li>
      </ul>

    </br>
      <h2> Work </h2>
      <p> The last 7 years I've worked in HR. The last three years I've worked as an Area Sales Director for a fairly new, growing interim agency called Trixxo Jobs.
        I was responsable for the growth of the company in Antwerp. I've started with one office with two consultants, and opened six offices and build a team of 25 people.
       </p>
     </br>
       <p> I decided that I wanted something more. I want to learn, develop and get to know a new niche. Mid october I'll start the Switchfully Analist CLass.
         Afterwards I'll join the Flanders Digital team of Owen Cisk as a Business Analyst. </p>
